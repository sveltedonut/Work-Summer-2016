%  This computes a score minimizing the regularized negative log
%  likelihood for a response pattern in U.  thata_in is the initial
%  value, and functional data object WFDOBJ is an expansion for the
%  functions log[P/(1-P)] associated with each item.  
%  The negative log likelihood for each theta value is regularized by 
%  attaching a penalty proportional to the squared difference
%  between the theta value and the icorresponding quantile of the scaled 
%  beta distribution over [0,n] with parameters ALPHA, BETA, H0 and HN.  
%  Only the quantile values for each case are required, and these are
%  computed externally and supplied in argument THETA_Q.
%  
%  Arguments are:
%  THETA_IN ... Initial values for abilities in [0,n].  It is assumed
%               that values corresponding to rows of U that are all
%               0's will be 0, and values corresponding to all 1's will be
%               n's.
%               This is a column vector of size N, where N is the number
%               of examinees.  The numbers will be in [0,n] and will be
%               floating point numbers rather than integers, where n is
%               the number of test items.
%  WFDOBJ   ... Functional data object defining the log-odds functions
%               for item characteristic curves and their smoothing.
%               A functional data object, consisting of n curves, each
%               a common basis object and a set of coefficients for
%               the expansion of the function in terms of the basis
%               functions.  The coefficient matrix (retrieved by the
%               getcoefs(basisobj) command) will have n columns and
%               K rows, where K is the number of basis functions.  In this
%               we are using spline basis functions.
%  DATASTR  ... A struct object with fields
%               U   ... N by n matrix of 0's and 1's indicating item 
%                       failure and success, respectively, for each of N  
%                       examinees and for each of n items.
%               IND ... The indices of the rows of U which are neither 
%                       all 0's or all 1's.  These numbers will be integers
%                       in the range 1 ... N and the size of the one-col
%                       array will be the numbere of examinees having 
%                       scores that are neither 0 or n.
%               TQ  ... A vector of length N containing the quantiles of 
%                       the tilted scaled beta distribution corresponding
%                       to the sum scores.  
%                       This is a single column of N float numbers.
%                       If SLAMBDA is missing or set to zero, these values  
%                       are not used and the argument can be [].
%  SLAMBDA  ... A smoothing parameter used to shrink ability parameters in
%               THETA towards the corresponding quantile of the 
%               scaled beta distribution fit to the sum scores.
%               This is a non-negative float number.
%  ITERMAX  ... Maximum number of iterations for computing the optimal
%               theta values.  Default is 20.
%               This is a nonnegative integer.
%  CRIT     ... Criterion for convergence of optimization.  Default is 1e-8
%               This is a positive float.
